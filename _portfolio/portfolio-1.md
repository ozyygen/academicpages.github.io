About Workshop
===

The 4th two-day KnowGraphs workshop took place at Vienna University. I had the opportunity to listen to educational seminars that developed academic skills, and to participate in activities with other KnowGraphs researchers.

A night train or a plane?

    <p> For both personal and environmental reasons, I preferred a night train for my journey to Vienna. I searched <a href="https://www.nightjet.com/en/">Ã¶bb</a> website for a one-person sleeping cabin 15 days before my journey, and I realized I was a bit late. One-person sleeping cabins are difficult to find but it is worth it! Just imagine waking up to this view! </p>

To make it more orderly, I'll compare the pros/cons.

Pros

- Personally, my journey was less stressful than other public transport because of a private cabin which has a comfortable bed, a sink, and less but not the least a lot of space to move! You can adjust lights, and room temperature and announce sounds with buttons. Also, breakfast is served in the morning from your selection.
- Environmentally, it was gratifying for me to be a part of preventing tens of kilos of carbon dioxide emissions. 
- Normally, I can't sleep during my journeys but the train created a conducive environment for me to sleep.
- When I woke up my journey was about to end I felt no tiredness.
- I'm not sure if these are available on every night train, but you can take your car with you in additional wagons and you can use a shared shower.

Cons

- There was a delay of about 1 hour on both of my journeys. After night trains, to reach my city, I had to transfer with other trains that I bought a ticket for 15 days ago as well. Luckily, I had no problems as I took those trains with more than an hour of waiting time. It's good to keep that in mind!
- I did not find the sound insulation between the cabins very successful. If you have loud neighbors, this may bother you.
- You must have all your luggage with you. If you have a lot of luggage, this may make you uncomfortable.
